# 2k-rating
After going down a YouTube rabbit hole and watching a compilation of NBA players complain about their 2K ratings, I started wondering what 2K takes into account when they decide those ratings. I wanted to see if I can try predicting the ratings using a few of the more common statistics such as points, assists, and rebounds with regression models in Python.

I wrote a Python script to scrape 2K ratings from hoopshype.com and downloaded stats of every NBA player in the past 7 seasons from basketball-reference.com to form the dataset I used in this project.
